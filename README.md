 # Employee Attrition Prediction
## This project was the partial fulfilment of the requirements for BITS AIML course.

## Problem statement (what is the problem being addressed)
Employees are the pillars of organization and workforce retention is one of the key factor in
measuring the organizational growth. But swelling attrition levels across the businesses are strait-
jacketing the distraught HR practitioner’s ability to come out with good retention strategies.
Employee attrition must be decreased for a firm as it increases the high training cost and the crucial
business time of an organization


## Objective of the project
After proving its mettle in sales and marketing, artificial intelligence is also becoming central to
employee-related decisions within HR management.
Therefore, the objective is to build a model to predict employee attrition which could help human
resource department strategize hiring and retention process.
• The objective is also to thoroughly understand the data in hand and derive business insights,
come up with recommendations for better employee retention and build a Predictive model
that would help predict the required information in an efficient manner

## Need of Employee Attrition Prediction:
Managing workforce: If the supervisors or HR came to know about some employees that
they will be planning to leave the company then they could get in touch with those
employees and can convince them to stay back through various negotiations.
Smooth pipeline: If all the employees in the current project are working continuously on
a project, then the pipeline of that project will be smooth but if one efficient asset of the
project(employee) suddenly leaves that company, then the workflow will be disturbed
and won’t be so smooth any longer.
Hiring Management: If HR came to know about the employee of a particular project is
willing to leave the company, then he/she can manage the number of hiring and they can
get the valuable asset whenever they need for the efficient flow of work.
